Version 1.4.1   -   Updated: Sep. 14, 2014

This Plug-In will auto-complete or auto-suggest completed search queries
for you as you type. You can add multiple selections and remove them on
the fly. It supports keybord navigation (UP + DOWN + RETURN), as well
as multiple AutoSuggest fields on the same page.
